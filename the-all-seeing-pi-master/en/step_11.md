## Working with overlays

- The All-Seeing Pi is no ordinary photo booth! The second button we set up, `next_overlay_btn`, is used to change between 'overlays': these are fun pictures such as hats, beards, and glasses which appear on the screen as if you are wearing them. Here is an example of a picture taken with an overlay:

    ![Rik with pigtail overlay](images/rik-picture.png)

    You can make your own overlays, or use the ready-made ones we have provided for you to download. If you are creating your own overlays, make sure that they are saved at 800 Ã— 480 resolution as PNG files, with the background set to transparent.

- Create a subfolder called `overlays` within your `allseeingpi` folder, and place your overlay images inside it.

- Navigate to the [overlays folder](https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/the-all-seeing-pi/tree/master/en/resources) of the GitHub repo for this project. Click on the filename of the overlay you would like to use, then right-click on the download link and save the image into the `overlays` folder you just created. Repeat this process until you have saved all of the overlays you would like to use.

- Now [right-click here](resources/overlay_functions.py) and save this file as `overlay_functions.py`. Make sure you save this file in your `allseeingpi` directory (where the `allseeingpi.py` script is also saved). 

- In the `overlay_functions.py` file, find this comment:

    ```
    # EDIT THESE VALUES ------------------------
    ```

    You will need to change this code to specify two things:
    
      - Set the `overlays_dir` to the directory where your overlays are stored. If you are following this tutorial exactly, you will **not** need to change this directory location.
      - Set the `overlays` to be a list of the filenames of the overlays (without extension), surrounded by quotes and separated by commas. For example, if you had overlay images called `rock.png`, `paper.png`, and `scissors.png`, your line of code would look like this:

    ```python
    overlays = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
    ```

- Now go back to your `allseeingpi.py` program. Underneath the other import statements in your program, add another one to import this file:

    ```python
    from overlay_functions import *
    ```

  This will allow us to use all of the overlay functions defined in the `overlay_functions.py` file from within our `allseeingpi.py` file.
