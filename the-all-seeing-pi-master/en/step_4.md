## Connecting the Raspberry Pi touchscreen

- Set up your Raspberry Pi touchscreen. There is a [good tutorial](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/45295044-raspberry-pi-7-touch-screen-assembly-guide) available to help you. Ensure that you power the touchscreen via the Raspberry Pi with jumper leads as shown in the tutorial, and that the power supply you use is a good quality one.

- Situate your screen within the housing of your choice, ensuring you can still access the Raspberry Pi.
