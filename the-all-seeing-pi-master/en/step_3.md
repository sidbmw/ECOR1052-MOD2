## Making the photo booth housing
You can create your All-Seeing Pi using any housing you like. Our first iteration used a humble cardboard box, but you might want to create a masterpiece of carpentry or laser-cutting wizardry to hold your All-Seeing Pi.

If you don't have fancy buttons or a touchscreen, that's OK too: you can still make the All-Seeing Pi! Here is a picture of the setup we used when creating this resource: the only extra hardware requirements are two tactile push buttons, four jumper leads, a breadboard, and a Camera Module. You can use your usual monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
